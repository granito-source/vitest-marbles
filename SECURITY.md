# Security Policy

Granito takes the security of our code seriously. If you believe you have found
a security vulnerability in the _Vitest Marbles_, please **DO NOT** disclose
it publicly until we’ve had a chance to fix it. Please don’t report security
vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead follow the instructions below
to disclose it responsibly.

## Supported Versions

_Vitest Marbles_ has not been released yet. We publish developer previews,
which allow us to refine the API of the library in real-world projects.
As such, only the latest published developer preview should be considered when
reporting security issues.

Going forward, after the first release is published, the latest two major releases
will be supported for security updates as well as the upcoming major release
(code in _main_ branch).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability, please
[open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/granito-source/vitest-marbles/security/advisories/new)
to disclose your findings privately.
